Project Two: Your First Full Stack Application



VIDEO OF PROJECT 2 ANNOUNCEMENT

Overview
This second project is your first foray into building a full-stack application. You'll be building a Node/Express/MongoDB app from the ground up yourself.

You will be working individually for this project; you'll be designing and coding the app yourself.

You get to decide what you want to build - as long as it meets the technical requirements outlined below.

Once you've decided what you will build, please contact your instructional team for approval of your idea and then begin working on the Planning & Presentation Requirements below.




Planning & Presentation Requirements
To receive a passing grade on this project, you need to have turned in the following:

A Trello board with:

User Stories, each moving from left to right in the following three lists in your board:
Ice Box
Current/MVP
Completed
User Stories must follow the following template: As a user, I want [feature], because [reason].

The reason is optional if it's blatantly obvious.



Note: Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish list" stories at the bottom.

Wireframes of the main pages of functionality, e.g. Landing Page, Posts Index Page, Favorite Posts Page, Add Post Page, etc.

An ERD showing the attributes of each model (or schema in the case of embedding) and the associations between them.



Here's a YouTube video to show you how.

Finished Project Presentation
You will have a maximum of 5 minutes to present your project following these guidelines:

Introduce the Project:

☐ Intro your app by paraphrasing the README.

Demonstrate the Project:

☐ Launch the app by clicking the link in the README.

☐ (If auth added) - sign up a new user, then immediately log out.

☐ (If auth added) - log in with your preferred user and demonstrate the features of the app.

☐ Be sure to demo full-CRUD data operations.

Show/discuss your code:

☐ Show the "main" Mongoose model.

☐ Show your favorite EJS template.

☐ Show the controller for the main model.

Share the experience:

☐ What was your biggest challenge?

☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?

Q & A + Feedback




Technical Requirements
Your App Must:
☐ Have at least 1 data entity in addition to the "User" Model (If doing Auth). This entity must represent the main functional idea for your app. (example: "Journal Entry for a Journal App", "Video Game for a Video Game Library Tracker", etc.

☐ Have complete CRUD data operations on one of your data entities.

☐ Use a CSS stylesheet (Additional Use of a CSS Framework such as Bootstrap or Materialize is optional, however your must have your own stylesheet with some styles defined as well)

☐ Be deployed online (Render or Railway) - Here is a Video on how Deploy an Express App




Optionally, Your App May:
☐ Use authentication.

☐ Implement basic authorization by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource.

☐ Consume a third-party API.

☐ Expose its own API where it returns data resources as JSON. (You will need to research how to do this ... hint res.json())




Necessary Deliverables
☐ A working full-stack app that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on Heroku.

A README.md file with these sections:

☐ <Your app's title>: A description of your app. Background info of the app is a nice touch.

☐ Screenshot(s): Images of your actual app.

☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

☐ Getting Started: In this section include the link to your deployed app and any instructions you deem important.

☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style landing page" instead of "Styled landing page".




Suggested Ways to Get Started
If your app's functionality revolves around the logged in user, implement authentication and basic navigation first! Build to learn How to do Session Based on Auth in Express
Discuss your app idea with an instructor to get their feedback before you dive too deep into user stories and wireframes.
Remember to keep things small and focus on the MVP – feature creep can doom a project!



Project Idea Guidance
Nearly all of the applications you interact with on a daily basis would do for this project as most are "full-stack" CRUD apps.




Do Not Do Non-CRUD Applications Such As:
Games
Portfolio, or presentational pages
Marketing or content oriented websites



Good Examples
Some of the best apps are solutions that track or manage things of personal interest to you:

Music lesson tracking
Soccer team tracker
Rock climbing planner
So much of the Internet is CRUD apps!

Social media:
Twitter
Instagram
Reddit
Marketplaces:
Craigslist
Etsy
Organizational or Business apps:
Customer management
Payroll/Accounting
Many simple apps can have their functionality enhanced by implementing the ability of users to comment on, and/or like/favorite items.

Another piece of advice: If you choose to develop an app that has the concept of a shopping cart (storefront), do not attempt to implement the actual payment functionality.

Project Feedback + Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated as pass or fail pass on the criteria outlined above.
